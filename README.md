Image Processing project on the Brain Tumour Extraction from MRI Images Using MATLAB 

Steps of algorithm are as following:-

1) Give MRI image of brain as input. 
2) Convert it to gray scale image. 
3) Compute threshold segmentation. 
4) Compute watershed segmentation. 
5) Compute morphological operation. 
6) Finally output will be a tumour region.
